A comprehensive mapping of old subreddits to new communities.

* * *

With /r/startrek [moving to Lemmy](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/14a5t8w/looking_for_an_alternative_to_reddit_to_talk_trek/), I realized that Redditors are going to need a way to find their old communities on Lemmy/Kbin.

Here's a quick and dirty list that you can [contribute to](#). Put new entries in alphabetical order. Pull requests welcome!

## The List

| Subreddit | New Community | | Status | Announcement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| r/startrek | !startrek@startrek.website | [ðŸ”—](https://startrek.website/c/startrek) | Official | [Looking for an alternative to reddit to talk Trek? Join us on Lemmy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/14a5t8w/looking_for_an_alternative_to_reddit_to_talk_trek/) |
